I'm a Software developer from MontrÃ©al, Canada. Current timezone: UTC-4.

Currently focusing on Python development, mostly [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and my own libraries for work and fun.

Also currently learning:
* Rust
* Svelte

## Open Source Contributions:

I contribute open source whenever I get frustrated at a library, don't expect to see much here.

- ðŸ“ˆ Improved typing hints for [prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator/releases/tag/v5.11.1)
- ðŸ“š More to come!
